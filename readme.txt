Required Libraries and Dependencies
1-Python: The application requires Python 3.7 or higher. Make sure Python is installed and added to the system's PATH.

2-OpenCV: Used for image processing and video capture.

    Install using: pip install opencv-python

3-Mediapipe: Used for face detection and face mesh processing.

    Install using: pip install mediapipe

4-NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.

    Install using: pip install numpy

5-Face Recognition: Used for face recognition and encoding.

    Install using: pip install face_recognition
    Note: This library depends on dlib, which requires a C++ compiler and cmake to be installed.

6-OS: A standard Python library used for file and directory operations. No installation is required.

7-CMake: Required for building dlib, which is a dependency of face_recognition.

    Install using: pip install cmake

8-Dlib: A dependency for face_recognition that handles face detection and encoding.

    Install using: pip install dlib
    Note: On some systems, you may need to install a C++ compiler (e.g., Xcode on macOS or Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows).
